    vdp_colors.bmp          A reference of VDP colors to use in your images.

### Usage guide

    tmscolor [options] image.bmp image.asm [label]
    
    -sms   Generates Sega Master System format.
    -b     Generates CVBasic source code.
    -n     Removes CVBasic stub code for displaying.
    -s     Process tiles in chunks of 16 pixels high (sprites).
    -sb    Same as above but generates readable bitmap statements (CVBasic mode)
    -t     Generates minimum of tiles required.
    -t1    Same but starting at tile 1 (0-255).
    -e45d2 Replaces color 4 with 5 and d with 2 before processing.
    -fx    Flip image along the X-coordinate (mirror)
    -fy    Flip image along the Y-coordinate
    -i     Generates BITMAP statements instead of DATA
    -i2    Generates BITMAP statements using X and .
    -m     Generates magic sprites for areas with more than 2 colors
    -p1    Searches best color combination for photo (slow)
    -p2    Searches best color combination for photo (2x2 dither) (slow)
    -o result.bmp
           Outputs the final image, plus highlight of errors (if any).

By default it converts the image to assembler code (use option -b for CVBasic code). The *label* argument is for the label name used in the code.

Best photo conversion is generated by this command line:

    tmscolor -p2 photo.bmp photo.asm
    
Or for CVBasic:
    
    tmscolor -b -p2 photo.bmp photo.bas
    
Photos will look better if the contrast is good. Magic sprites will work only with an image of 256x192 pixels.

Currently for Sega Master System you should use the standard VDP colors, and you can provide your palette inside your game or program (for example, using the PALETTE LOAD sentence of CVBasic). It is way easier than trying to calculate a palette inside TMSColor.


### Notes
